# PROJECT - AERIS

Stand: 2026-02-26
Status: Pivot to VS Code Fork & CLI Dual-Use Case

## Purpose

AERIS is the **Supreme Orchestrator** in the Jannis Work-OS ecosystem.
It now targets a dual-use implementation:
1. **VS Code Fork:** A powerful, AI-native IDE built on a modular VS Code foundation (Void).
2. **CLI Tool:** A high-performance terminal orchestrator for advanced automation and remote control.

AERIS integrates deeply with **Vox-Voice** (Senses), **Wanda-Repo** (Brain & Tools), and the **Architect Canvas** (Logic).

## Current Focus (SOTA Integration)

- **Native Logic Canvas:** Integration of the **Architect Canvas V4.0** (Excalidraw/React) as a native webview extension in the VS Code Fork.
- **Visual Handshake:** Mandatory two-step planning (Logic Canvas & UI/UX Designer) before core logic implementation.
- **Unified Memory:** Implementing Tier 2 & 3 memory shared with other nodes in the ecosystem.
- **Supreme Orchestration:** Parallel agent swarms, terminal monitoring, and validation loops.
